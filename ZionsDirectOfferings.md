This means we do not bill Medicare and Medicare will not reimburse for services provided by our clinic. Medicare beneficiaries are welcome to receive care with us under a private agreement and are responsible for payment at the time of service, however, **due to federal law, we are unable to provide urgent or emergent care to Medicare beneficiaries**.

Patients are free to seek care from Medicare-participating providers at any time.
